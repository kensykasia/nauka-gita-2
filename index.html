    <h1>Bandit queen</h1>
    <h2>Looptroop</h2>
    <p class="first-verse">
      Ey yo bust it: when the police come yo she ready for whatever
      Never talk to the cops cus she got her mind together
      A down to earth mother earth living at the speed of life
      She don't need a ring to be my wife
      A truly independent woman, not a destiny's child
      Not depending on money or fashion to have style
      She got nuff style - rough style - diamond in the ruff
      Not a dimepiece in the back, she a diamond in the front
      Seat by my side, ready to ride
      With a smile on her face when she let me inside
      What is this? I need a gangsta bitch, I need love
      I need a ride or die bitch? None of the above
      I need a terrorist chick taking care of this dick
      Ain't nothing superficial like marriage and shit
      A truly holy matrimony she my homie
      I forget about this evil world when she hold me
