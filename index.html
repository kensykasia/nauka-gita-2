      	      Ey yo bust it: when the police come yo she ready for whatever
      	      Never talk to the cops cus she got her mind together
      	      A down to earth mother earth living at the speed of life
      	      She don't need a ring to be my wife
      	      A truly independent woman, not a destiny's child
      	      Not depending on money or fashion to have style
      	      She got nuff style - rough style - diamond in the ruff
      	      Not a dimepiece in the back, she a diamond in the front
      	      Seat by my side, ready to ride
      	      With a smile on her face when she let me inside
      	      What is this? I need a gangsta bitch, I need love
      	      I need a ride or die bitch? None of the above
      	      I need a terrorist chick taking care of this dick
      	      Ain't nothing superficial like marriage and shit
      	      A truly holy matrimony she my homie
      	      I forget about this evil world when she hold me

      				I need a riot girl, not a violent girl
      				but one that knows how to defend herself when they try to quiet her
      				In this manmade era of gangrapes and terror
      				Where most men can't face the mirror
      				She overcome cus she positive
      				She live in love and she love to live
      				She love to give and love to take
      				She don't compete cus she above the fake
      				She don't deal with no silly silicone
      				Even when I'm not with her I don't really feel alone
      				cus there's a metaphysical bond between us
      				Strong as my penis want the venus
      				I need the butts and no maybes
      				I see some ladies tonight that should be having my babies
      				You know what I mean?
      				Wanna roll with my team well you know what I need

              I need a bandit queen, but man it seems
              that the whole world is living in some candy dream
              They want a plastic screen - not flesh and blood
              They want some bad machine - not blessed love
              They're stressed enough for ulcers and bloodclouts
              grey hairs and great fears of what nots
              I feel alone in this cold world
              but out of 5 billion people there should be a soulgirl
              My soulmate not afraid to hold weight
              Baby your soulfood I love it homemade
              The way you stir it up I ain't coming home late
              Your recipe is so tasty - give me the whole plate
